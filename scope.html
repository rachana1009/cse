                  <h5>B.E./B.TECH. COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING: BASIC COURSE DETAILS:</h5><br>
<p>It is a 4 years long Undergraduate Level Degree program. The 4 years’ duration is divided into 8 semesters, with each semester lasting a period of 6 months. During each semester, students will have to face different sets of theoretical subjects as well as practical lab sessions associated with them.
<br>
 

B.E./B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering is all about Computer Sciences, programming languages, software development and testing, networking etc. It also focuses on using the above mentioned skills and knowledge for practical and Industry specific usage.
<br>
 

To get a better idea about the structure of the course, I’ve created a list of some of the most important subjects present in B.E./B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering program. Come, let us take a look at it-
